  <h1>Theme</h1>
  <p>
  You can change the theme of the components by creating a new stylesheet theme and importing it in your project.
  </p>
  <p>
  Here is an example of a theme file:
  </p>
  <p>
  All the colors are defined by 3 numbers, because theses variables are used to create the different shades of the colors.
  The numbers are the RGB values of the color.
  </p>
  <pre><code
    [languages]="['scss']"
    [highlight]="themeStyle"  [lineNumbers]="true"></code></pre>
